## Description

The Weather App is a responsive web application built using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to check the weather forecast for different locations. The app uses the Axios library to fetch weather data from an external API.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable UI components, making it easier to manage the app's interface.

- **Redux**: Redux is used for state management in the Weather App. It helps maintain a centralized store for application data, making it easier to manage and share state between components.

- **Redux Saga Middleware**: Redux Saga is utilized as middleware to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. It helps manage side effects, such as making API requests, in a more organized and efficient manner.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the Weather App. It is a utility-first CSS framework that enables the rapid development of responsive and beautifully designed user interfaces. Tailwind CSS classes are used to style components and create a visually appealing user interface.

- **Axios**: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to an external weather API. It allows the app to retrieve weather data for different locations and display it to the user.
